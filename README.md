## Tools and Technologies

### Developer Tools

#### IDE
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)**: A lightweight but powerful source code editor that supports various programming languages and frameworks. Features include debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

#### Dependency Management
- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)**: A tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It provides a comprehensive way to manage project dependencies, build packages, and publish them to PyPI.

#### Containerization and Deployment
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. It enables consistent environments across multiple development and production stages.
- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)**: An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides features like load balancing, storage orchestration, and automated rollouts and rollbacks.

#### Version Control
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc)**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It supports branching, merging, and collaboration through repositories.

### ETL

#### Orchestration Framework
- **[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/)**: A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to manage task dependencies and execution order.

#### Databases
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)**: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and SQL compliance. It supports advanced data types and performance optimization features.

### Data Visualization
